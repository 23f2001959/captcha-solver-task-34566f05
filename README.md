# Captcha Solver Task

This project aims to develop a robust captcha solver to automatically solve captcha challenges encountered on various websites.

## Setup

To use the captcha solver, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the captcha solver, simply run the `solver.py` script and pass the path to the captcha image as an argument:

```
python solver.py path/to/captcha_image.png
```

The solver will then attempt to solve the captcha challenge and print the result to the console.

## Code Explanation

The captcha solver works by utilizing image processing techniques to extract the characters from the captcha image. Once the characters are extracted, the solver uses machine learning algorithms to recognize the characters and solve the captcha challenge.
